# Always

So basic and so easy to make yes but its the effort that counts. I thought about it just this afternoon while driving so I did not have enought time.
This is my last effort and I dedicated this to someone I loved. <br>Someone I loved deeply.<br> Someone I loved with no conditions and no expectations in return.<br> Someone I loved in ways I never knew I was capable.<br> Someone I loved purely and with respect.<br> Someone I loved more than she ever knew.<br> Someone who will always have a space in my heart... And I will continue to love this someone, even if the 
future no longer includes me. I wish you well. Please keep safe.

"Title: The Playlist" "These songs remind me of you of how constant my love has always been, and a way to hold you when words fall short. I made this playlist to remind you that no matter how heavy things feel, no matter how far or quiet it gets, my love for you doesn’t change. It doesn’t leave. It doesn’t weaken.

Each song carries pieces of how I love you  gently, patiently, and with intention. I hope they make you feel held and reassured, because that’s how I love you: steadily, sincerely, and always.

When things feel heavy, when your heart gets tired, I hope these songs remind you that you are cared for, valued, and never alone. You don’t have to be strong here. You can rest. Even in silence, even from a distance, my love stays steady, holding space for you, the way you deserve to be loved.

Note: Sorry if the playlist feels a bit short right now. I’m taking my time to pick songs that really describe how I feel about you and assure you about my love, I'll be adding more as I go. :) Thank you for your patience and for understanding."

Fix bug in the music page and add some songs because i'm confused how to add them. Everything should be working.
