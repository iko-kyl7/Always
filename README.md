# Always

So basic and so easy to make yes but its the effort that counts. I thought about it just this afternoon while driving so I did not have enought time.
This is my last effort and I dedicated this to someone I loved. <br>Someone I loved deeply.<br> Someone I loved with no conditions and no expectations in return.<br> Someone I loved in ways I never knew I was capable.<br> Someone I loved purely and with respect.<br> Someone I loved more than she ever knew.<br> Someone who will always have a space in my heart... And I will continue to love this someone, even if the future no longer includes me. I wish you well. Please keep safe.
